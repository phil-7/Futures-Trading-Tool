# Futures-Trading-Tool

The purpose of this project is to create a Futures application/program/GUI that takes in a combination of closing prices and opening prices to help decide on buying/selling.
Uses oscillators, indices, and other technical data for that day to inform decision making.

Potentially using an App/GUI? Looking into reading data through a Futures PI. If not, reading a csv file could be a solution. The last resort is user input
